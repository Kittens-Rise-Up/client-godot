Coding Guidelines

Formatting
- Fields, properties and functions should follow PascalFormat
- Try to use Properties over Fields whenever possible
- Try to use 'var' whenever possible
- Almost always use floats unless Godot specifically requires you to use a double

Tips
- Try to keep track of scope, if a variable does not need to be global then make it local so it does not waste that precious memory
- Please keep track of every Godot node instance you created, if the instance is not added to the scene it will become a orphan node and show up in Godots verbose debug log and will be a pain to debug later on
