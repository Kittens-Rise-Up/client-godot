## Raccoons Rise Up
Raccoons Rise Up is a mostly text based progressive resource management MMORPG. Players will be able to purchase structures with resources which in turn will generate more resources. Research from the tech tree will help speed up this process. Players will also be able to assign raccoons to jobs to make resource gathering slightly more interesting.
