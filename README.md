# Kittens Rise Up Game Client

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6277739/132770788-9de196ea-548b-4ae7-8e95-4e2a7bbdfa50.png)

Here's a quick rundown of what's been done for the client.
- User can retrieve JWT from web-server and use that to login to game server (all done in one click of a button "Login")
- On successful login, client receives all structure data, and this gets populated in "Store" section
- Player can click on "Hut" or "Farm" and some details will be displayed on the right
- Player can click "Buy" and send a PurchasePacket to server

Things that eventually need to be done
- Finishing the other UI sections
- Kittens Section: You should be able to assign kittens to jobs such as wood cutting, farming, foraging, etc...
- Structures Section: Simply display structure counts
- Resources Section: Showing simulation of resource gains in realtime on client-end (and updated from server whenever those rates change)
- Research Section: Add lines between tech, add code to handle tech tree stuff
- Map Section: This is where the player will be able to interact with other players
